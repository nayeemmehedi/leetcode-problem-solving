You bring up a great point! Many data structures and algorithms are interrelated, and understanding them often involves tackling overlapping topics. Here’s a more tailored approach to learning data structures and algorithms (DSA) that acknowledges this overlap and provides a clear path for you:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Learning DSA

1. **Start with Basic Concepts**
   - **Understanding Time Complexity**: Before diving into specific data structures, get comfortable with big O notation and time complexity analysis. This will help you understand the efficiency of algorithms.

2. **Arrays and Strings**
   - **Arrays**: Learn about basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) and simple problems (e.g., finding the maximum/minimum, reversing an array).
   - **Strings**: Study common string manipulations (substrings, concatenation, comparisons).

3. **Searching Algorithms**
   - **Linear Search**: Understand how to search through an array or list using a simple linear approach.
   - **Binary Search**: After grasping arrays, learn binary search, which is a powerful search technique used on sorted arrays. Practice problems that utilize binary search directly on arrays (e.g., finding the square root, searching for a target).

4. **Linked Lists**
   - Understand linked lists (singly and doubly). Solve basic problems like reversing a linked list and detecting cycles.
   - Linked lists will help you understand pointers and memory management, which are crucial for more complex data structures.

5. **Fundamental Data Structures**
   - **Stacks and Queues**: Learn stack operations (push, pop) and queue operations (enqueue, dequeue). Solve problems like balanced parentheses using stacks and implementing queues using stacks.
   - **Hash Tables**: Get familiar with hash functions, collision resolution, and solving problems like finding duplicates or counting elements.

6. **More Advanced Data Structures**
   - **Trees**: Start with binary trees, then explore binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and heap structures. 
     - **Practice**: Problems involving tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder) and finding the lowest common ancestor.
   - **Graphs**: Learn graph representations (adjacency list/matrix) and explore traversal techniques (DFS and BFS).
     - **Practice**: Problems related to connected components, shortest paths, and graph cycles.

7. **Algorithmic Techniques**
   - **Sorting Algorithms**: Study common sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort) and practice implementing them.
   - **Dynamic Programming**: Start with classic problems (Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem). Gradually tackle more complex DP problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

8. **Problem-Solving Strategies**
   - **Backtracking**: Learn this strategy through problems like N-Queens and permutations.
   - **Greedy Algorithms**: Study how greedy strategies work and practice problems that require this approach.

9. **Advanced Topics**
   - **Advanced Data Structures**: Trie, segment trees, and binary indexed trees (BIT). Understand their applications in string search and range queries.
   - **Graph Algorithms**: Explore algorithms for minimum spanning trees (like Prim's and Kruskal's) and advanced shortest path algorithms (like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford).

### Tips for Learning and Practice
- **Practice Problems by Topic**: As you learn a new data structure or algorithm, immediately practice related problems on platforms like LeetCode. This helps reinforce your understanding.
- **Solve Problems in Context**: When you encounter an array problem that involves binary search, don’t hesitate to tackle it directly. The key is to understand how binary search applies in that context.
- **Build on Previous Knowledge**: Each new concept should build on what you've already learned. For instance, understanding arrays and strings will make learning about trees and graphs easier.
- **Use Visual Aids**: Tools like visualgo.net or other graph and tree visualizers can help you understand complex structures and algorithms visually.

### Example Learning Path
1. **Week 1-2**: Arrays and Strings
   - Learn basic operations, sorting algorithms, and binary search.

2. **Week 3-4**: Linked Lists and Basic Searching
   - Focus on linked list operations and solve problems related to both arrays and linked lists.

3. **Week 5-6**: Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables
   - Implement stacks and queues; solve related problems, then explore hash tables.

4. **Week 7-8**: Trees and Basic Graphs
   - Study tree structures, traversals, and graph representations; solve basic traversal problems.

5. **Week 9-10**: Advanced Graphs and Dynamic Programming
   - Focus on graph algorithms and start dynamic programming basics.

6. **Ongoing**: Continue solving problems across all topics, revisiting challenging areas, and gradually moving to advanced topics.

### Conclusion
It’s perfectly fine to jump into binary search or other algorithms if you encounter them in context. The key is to learn concepts thoroughly while continually practicing related problems. This iterative learning and problem-solving process will solidify your understanding and prepare you for more advanced topics in DSA.
