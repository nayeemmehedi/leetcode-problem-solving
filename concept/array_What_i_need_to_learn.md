### Sample Solutions
Here are solutions for a couple of problems to get you started:

#### Problem 1: Find Maximum and Minimum in an Array
```javascript
function findMaxMin(arr) {
    let max = arr[0];
    let min = arr[0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
        if (arr[i] < min) min = arr[i];
    }
    
    return { max, min };
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5];
console.log(findMaxMin(arr)); // { max: 9, min: 1 }
```

#### Problem 2: Two Sum
```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map(); // Store index of each number
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i]; // Return indices
        }
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    
    return []; // Return empty array if no solution
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums, target)); // [0, 1]
```

### Conclusion
Start with the problems that you find the most interesting or challenging. Work through them systematically, understanding the concepts behind the solutions. Make sure to implement the solutions yourself and practice solving variations of each problem to reinforce your understanding. Good luck!
